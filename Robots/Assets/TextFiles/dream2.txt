I had a dream last night.
I was taking my usual route to the office, passing by the Pauly’s Pizza Printer to say “hi” to the bots. When I looked through the window none of them were there.
For a moment I thought that was odd, but then I remembered that the bots usually get there in the afternoon so it made sense. 
I peered through the glass to see if Pauly was in prepping toppings, but the restaurant was empty. Pauly is usually in by the time I go to work.
The lights were on, yet no one was there.
I kept walking and the clouds seemed to change, they were churning and swirling restlessly, ready to burst.
It began to rain and I ducked under an awning to look for my umbrella. 
The edges of my feet that were not protected by the awning began to oxidize, this layer of rust crept up towards my ankle joints.
I pushed my bag away from the edge of the awning and pulled my body towards it as the rust grew up my legs, locking them in place.
I scrambled through my bag looking for my umbrella as the splotches of orange and red thickened over my waist.
The awning was gone and as the rain plodded against my decaying frame, I saw a face in the restlessly churning clouds stare coldly at me.
Its features shifted between looking like my boss, the media mogul, and the politician; but they all had the same cold, spiteful eyes.
The rust was up to my shoulders, grounding my body. 
I looked desperately for anyone to help, but there was no one.
I was alone.
